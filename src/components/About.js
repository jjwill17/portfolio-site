            <p>Ever since I found my passion for coding, I haven't been able to quench the thirst I have for learning more. The first programming language that I started with was C++ and it was then that I decided that coding was one of the coolest things ever created. I have since put a lot of focus in JavaScript, while also looking into other programming languages and their awesome potential.</p>
